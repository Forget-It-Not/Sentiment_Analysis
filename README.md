# Sentiment_Analysis
Project developed as part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) subject of my Master's Degree in Data Science.  

This repository includes a python module with useful code to perform sentiment analysis on a set of texts like reviews from yelp (https://www.yelp.com/) or Amazon (https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/), a jupyter notebook that exemplifies how such analysis might be done and other auxiliary data (lists of search terms, lexicons, ...).
